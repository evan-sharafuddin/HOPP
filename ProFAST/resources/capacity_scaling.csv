Gas hourly specific space velocity (GHSV) of the reactor catalyst system is 1344 per hour and is based on a 50% reduction of combined reformer/WGS catalyst volume compared to a non-integrated natural gas steam reforming configuration.  The reactor vessel is based on a 4-pass annular heat exchange reformer configuration. Maximum process gas temperature is 550C.

Overall membrane surface area is 34.1ft^2 with a 90% hydrogen recovery.

The ferrite cycle directly uses concentrated solar power to provide thermal energy to a single integrated thermal receiver / chemical reactor to produce hydrogen. Due to the high reaction temperatures (well over 1,000 C), thermal storage is not practical for this system, so it operates only “on-sun”. With the exception of a small amount of electricity to power auxiliaries, the ferrite cycle is entirely thermally driven.
The  cycle investigated for detailed economic analysis is based on the thermal reduction of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4). This cycle is a two-step process, summarized in Table 2-2. The first step entails the  reduction of nickel ferrite to a metal oxide (Fe2+ + Fe3+ + Ni2+) at temperatures on the order of 1,450 C, during which oxygen is evolved; this is followed by the oxidation of metal oxide back to nickel ferrite at lower temperature (on the order of 1,000 C), during which hydrogen is evolved. The operating temperatures of the two steps were selected to maximize the equilibrium hydrogen conversion rate while maintaining the ferrite in its solid phase.",100000

The ferrite cycle directly uses concentrated solar power to provide thermal energy to a single integrated thermal receiver / chemical reactor to produce hydrogen.

The  cycle investigated for detailed economic analysis is based on the thermal reduction of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4). This cycle is a two-step process, summarized in Table 2-2. The first step entails the  reduction of nickel ferrite to a metal oxide (Fe2+ + Fe3+ + Ni2+) at temperatures on the order of 1,450 C, during which oxygen is evolved; this is followed by the oxidation of metal oxide back to nickel ferrite at lower temperature (on the order of 1,000 C), during which hydrogen is evolved.

The  cycle investigated for detailed economic analysis is based on the thermal reduction of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4). This cycle is a two-step process, summarized in Table 2-2. The first step entails the  reduction of nickel ferrite to a metal oxide (Fe2+ + Fe3+ + Ni2+) at temperatures on the order of 1,450 C, during which oxygen is evolved; this is followed by the oxidation of metal oxide back to nickel ferrite at lower temperature (on the order of 1,000 C), during which hydrogen is evolved. The operating temperatures of the two steps were selected to maximize the equilibrium hydrogen conversion rate while maintaining the ferrite in its solid phase.",100000

The ferrite cycle directly uses concentrated solar power to provide thermal energy to a single integrated thermal receiver / chemical reactor to produce hydrogen. Due to the high reaction temperatures (well over 1,000 C), thermal storage is not practical for this system, so it operates only “on-sun”.
